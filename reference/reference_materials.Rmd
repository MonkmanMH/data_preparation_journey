"the TL;DR is that it redirects the HTML output to the here::here("output") folder rather than writing output files to the same folder as the source code"

In the YAML:

```

knit:
  # override annoying knitr default & redirect HTML to "output" folder
  (function(inputFile, encoding) {
    outputFile <- gsub("Rmd$", "html", basename(inputFile))
    rmarkdown::render(
      input = inputFile,
      encoding = encoding,
      output_file = here::here("output", outputFile)
    )
  })


```
