## Structure

Tidy data\index{tidy data}

[@tidydata]



### Row counts (records)

Did your import step give you as many rows as you anticipated?


### Columns (variables)

Did your import step capture all of the variables?

Did the variables import as the correct classes?

Things to look for:

* did variables that should be numbers load as numeric types, or as character?

* if working with labelled variables, did they load as factor type?



## Validation
