# Importing data from statistical software {#importing-2}

In this chapter:

* Importing data from statistical software packages that include labelled data formats, with an emphasis on SPSS



## Statistical software


If you are one or work with statisticians, economists, sociologists, survey practitioners, and many others, you will find yourself encountering data files created using the software packages SAS\index{SAS}, SPSS\index{SPSS}, and Stata\index{Stata}. These tools have been around a long time (SAS and SPSS trace their history back to the late 1960s, and Stata was created in 1985), and over the years they have evolved, demonstrated their robustness, and have become common in many academic, corporate, and government settings. 

A feature of these programs is that the variables and the associated values can be _labelled_. If you're familiar with **R**, value labelling is conceptually similar to the use of factor labels. These labels can carry a great deal of detail to which you might otherwise not have easy access.

The **R** package {haven} [@R-haven] provides the functionality to read these three types of files. ^[The reference page for {haven} is here: https://haven.tidyverse.org/index.html] There are other packages related to {haven} that we will also use.


`library(haven)`


For these examples, we will work with SPSS formatted files; the approach is similar for the other two formats, and only differs in the details. For example, the `haven::read_()` functions vary only with the extension. For example, a Stata data file has the extension ".dta", so the read function is `read_dta()`:


```{r}

haven::read_dta(here::here("data", "penguins.dta"))

```

The equivalent for a SAS file is as follows:


```{r}

haven::read_sas(here::here("data", "penguins.sas"))

```

Here's the code to read that same data file in SPSS's ".sav" format and assigns it to an R object `penguins_sav`:

```{r}

penguins_sav <- haven::read_sav(here::here("data", "penguins.sav"))

penguins_sav
```

You will notice that the variables in the `.sav` version of the `penguins` dataframe are different than what was read in from the `.csv` version. All of the variables, including those that were character strings, are numeric. For example the variable "species", instead of being a character, is a column of "1"s, "2"s, and "3"s.


### {labelled} -

The package {labelled}[@R-labelled] gives us a range of powerful tools for working with the variable labels, value labels and defined missing values in an SPSS\index{SPSS} (or SAS or Stata) dataframe that we have read into R using one of the {haven} functions.

```{r 250-labelled}
library(labelled)
```



The first function we will use is `look_for()`, which returns the labels, column types, and values of the variables in our data.

```{r 250-look_for}
look_for(penguins_sav)
```

In this view, we can spot the species names in the "values" column. Also notice that the "col_type" column shows "dbl+lbl": double and label. In this dataframe, there are no labels.

The function `var_label()` allows us to add a descriptive label to a variable. Here, we add a label to the `species` variable:

```{r}
var_label(penguins_sav$species) <- "Penguin species"

```

The label is now incorporated into the dataframe:

```{r}
look_for(penguins_sav)
```

It's also possible to add multiple labels. Note that in this example, a label is added to both "dbl+lbl" and "dbl" types.

```{r}
var_label(penguins_sav) <- list(island = "Island of record", 
                                body_mass_g = "Weight, in grams")

look_for(penguins_sav)
```



For more about {labelled}, see 

* http://larmarange.github.io/labelled/

* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/


The package's reference page is here: http://larmarange.github.io/labelled/index.html

As well, there is a good introduction to the functions in the package here: http://larmarange.github.io/labelled/articles/intro_labelled.html


#### Using labels

The labels in an dataframe created by {haven} can be converted to a factor type, using the `unlabelled()` function. 

If we were to tally the number of penguins in each species using the penguins dataframe that originated from the SPSS file, we would see this:

```{r}
penguins_sav %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally()

palmerpenguins::penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally()

```

In this version, the "species" variable retains the numeric values.

By applying the `unlabelled()` function, the "haven_labelled" type variables are transformed into factor types, with the labels now the values shown:

```{r}
penguins_sav %>% 
  unlabelled() %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally()

```


An alternative approach is the explicitly change the variable type, with a `to_factor` transformation inside one of the mutate functions. In this first example, the variable "species" is mutated from labelled to factor type.

```{r}
penguins_sav %>% 
  mutate(species = as_factor(species)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally
```


In this second variant, the `mutate_if()` function transforms all of the labelled variables.

```{r}
penguins_sav %>% 
  mutate_if(is.labelled, to_factor) %>% 
  group_by(species, island) %>% 
  tally()
```



### Reading an SPSS\index{SPSS} file: "Video"

The functionality of a labelled dataframe is very beneficial when working with survey data. The dataframe can contain the variable codes as captured in the form, the values associated with those values, as well as the text of the question in the label.

The file used in this example comes from the University of Sheffield Mathematics and Statistics Help's "Datasets for Teaching"
https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mash/statistics/datasets

> This dataset was collected by Scott Smith (University of Sheffield) to evaluate the use of best method for informing the public about a certain medical condition. There were three videos (New general video A, new medical profession video B, the old video C and a demonstration using props D). He wanted to see if the new methods were more popular so collected data using mostly Likert style questions about a range of things such as understanding and general impressions. This reduced dataset contains some of those questions and 4 scale scores created from summing 5 ordinal questions to give a scale score.

If you were working in SPSS, when you open the file, you would see the data like this:

![SPSS data view](img\video_view_data.PNG)


SPSS also gives you the option to view the variables:

![SPSS variable view](img\video_view_variable.PNG)

In this view, we can see both the variable names and the variable labels (in this case, the precise wording of the survey question).

![SPSS variable label](img\video_heard_label.PNG)

And we can also drill deeper, and see the value labels:

![SPSS variable label](img\video_heard_values.PNG)


The R package {haven} allows us to capture all of this information.



#### Read SPSSSPSS\index{SPSS} data into R

For the first step, we will read in the data with the default parameters.

```{r}

df_video <- read_spss(here("data", "Video_SPSS.sav"))

# display the data in the console
df_video

```

Note that in the variable descriptions, it includes `<S3: haven_labelled>` for those that bring the SPSS labels with them.

But some of the variable names have leading `@` (at sign)...they will cause us some headaches later, so let's use the `clean_names()` function from the {janitor} package [@R-janitor]^[The reference page for {janitor} is here: http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/] to clean them up.


```{r}

df_video <- janitor::clean_names(df_video)

```


Now, we can use the `look_for()` function from {labelled} to view the contents of the dataframe:


```{r 250-look_for_1, eval=FALSE}
look_for(df_video)
```


#### Handling missing values 

Very often, SPSS files will have "user defined missing values". As we see above, they have been coded as "NA". But often, the analysis of survey results will have multiple types of "missing values":

* respondent left the question blank

* respondent didn't answer the question because of skip logic

* the analyst may have decided to code "Don't know" or "Not applicable" as "missing" when calculating the percentages of responses in the other categories.

Depending on the circumstance, you may want to count some of these. For example, if there a lot of "Don't know" and "Not applicable" responses, you may wish to analyze which one it is (they mean very different things!) If the are all coded as "NA", you have lost that ability.

In the code below, adding the `user_na = TRUE` argument to the `read_spss()` function maintains the original values.

```{r 250_read_spss_video}
df_video <- read_spss(here("data", "Video_SPSS.sav"), user_na = TRUE)

df_video <- janitor::clean_names(df_video)

df_video

```

What were "NA" in the first version are now "0".


#### Exploring the data

The `attributes()` function gives us a way to view the details of the variables.

First, we can look at the attributes of the whole dataframe.

```{r}

attributes(df_video)

```

Or we can look at the attributes of a single variable; in this case, `heardofcondition`

```{r}

attributes(df_video$heardofcondition)

```

The `$label` is the question, and the `$labels` are the labels associated with each value, including N/A. Note that there's also a `$na_values` shown.

You can also string these together in our code. For example, if we want to see the value labels and nothing else, the code would be as follows:


```{r}

attributes(df_video$heardofcondition)$labels

```


## Creating a labelled dataframe from an Excel file

You might encounter a circumstance where the data collectors have originally used SPSS, SAS, or Stata, but because the receiving party doesn't have one of these proprietary tools, will share the data as an Excel file. Typically in these circumstances, the data collectors make the data available in two parts: 

* the individual records, with the variables coded numerically

* a separate "codebook", with the labels associated with each numeric value.


In the following example, the penguins data [@R-palmerpenguins] has been stored in an Excel file. The first sheet in this Excel file contains the data, where the values in the three character variables (species, island, and sex) have been converted to numeric codes. For example, for the species variable, the Adelie penguins are represented by the value "1", Chinstrap are represented by "2", and Gentoo are represented by "3".



```{r}
penguins_path <- here::here("data", "penguins_labelled.xlsx")

penguins_data <- read_excel(penguins_path, sheet = "penguins_values")

head(penguins_data)

```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# alternative approach with {dpjr} package
library(dpjr)
penguins_path <- dpjr_data("penguins_labelled.xlsx")

penguins_data <- read_excel(penguins_path, sheet = "penguins_values")


```


A glance at the dataframe shows that the variables "species", "island", and "sex" are all coded as numeric variables. Unlike the .sav file we read earlier in this chapter, this dataframe does not carry the labels as part of the variable.

We could write some code to apply labels and change the variable type, using the `val_labels()` function from the {labelled} package:

```{r}
# assign the species names as labels
labelled::val_labels(penguins_data$species) <- c("Adelie" = 1, "Chinstrap" = 2, "Gentoo" = 3)

# view the labels
val_labels(penguins_data$species)

# another way to view the labels 
attr(penguins_data$species, "labels")

```



We can also use R to read in the values, and apply them programmatically. This will save time and effort, and reduce the risk of typographical errors, particularly if there are many variables and those variables have many values to label.

If we return to the Excel file "penguins_labelled.xlsx" we find that the second sheet in the Excel file is called "penguins_codebook_source". This sheet contains output SPSS creates when the "DISPLAY DICTIONARY" syntax (or the "File > Display Data File Information > Working File" GUI menu sequence) in SPSS is used to produce the "dictionary" (or codebook). There is information about each of the variables, including whether that variable is nominal or scale.

Of particular interest to us are the values associated with each variable. This information is saved under the heading "Variable Values"; for the penguins data file, this appears in row 36 of the Excel sheet.

!["Variable Values" from penguins SPSS output](img/penguins_variable_values_spss.JPG)

First, we read the contents of specific rectangle of data in the second sheet in the Excel file, containing the codebook. Note that we start reading at row 37, so that row with "Value" and "Label" are assigned as our variable names. In this code, the "anchored" approach is used, where the upper left corner Excel cell is specified, and then the number of rows and columns to be read in the `dim =` argument.

```{r}

penguins_path <- here::here("data", "penguins_labelled.xlsx")

penguins_code <- read_excel(penguins_path,
                            sheet = "penguins_codebook",
                            range = anchored("A37", dim = c(9, 3)))

penguins_code


```

We have read the table as output by SPSS and saved in the Excel file, but there is additional wrangling required.

The first step in the pipe is to rename the variables. Not only has the "Value" been given to the "Variable" column, but the value has interpreted as blank, and has been given the variable name "...2". 

The second step is to use the {dplyr} `fill()` function to populate the missing values in the "variable" variable. The default direction of the fill is downwards, so we don't need to specify the direction as an argument. We will examine other options for cleaning data later.

```{r}

penguins_code <- penguins_code %>% 
  # rename variables
  rename(Value = "variable",
    ...2 = "variable_value",
    Label = "variable_label") %>% 
  # fill in blank names
  fill(variable) %>% 
  # change to numeric
  mutate(variable_value = as.numeric(variable_value))

penguins_code

```


At this point, there are two possible solutions:

1. Join the values from the "penguins_code" dataframe, so that in addition to the variable with numeric values, there is also a variable with the character strings.

2. Using the functions in the {labelled} package, convert the variables into "labelled" type, so the the numeric values remain and the labels are applied. In this scenario, the end-state is the same as reading the SPSS file directly.

#### Join variables


```{r}
penguins_code_wide <- penguins_code %>% 
#  mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(variable), values_from = variable_label)

penguins_code_wide
```



## Creating a labelled dataframe from SPSS syntax


To achieve this, we will use the functions in the package {memisc} [@R-memisc]

`library(memisc)`

This uses information from the National Travel Survey, collected and published by Statistics Canada [@StatCan_NTS_2020]. 

Step 1 - download the "SPSS" zip file for the 2020 reference period, and unzip it in the project sub-folder "data". This should create a sub-folder, so that the file path is now "data\\2020-spss"

The zip file does _not_ include an SPSS-format data file (.sav). Instead, the folder has a fixed-width text file for each of the three survey components (person, trips, and visits), and corresponding SPSS syntax files that can be used to read the files into the correct variables and to apply the variable and value labels. 

Step 2 - use the SPSS syntax files (in R)

For this example, we will use the 2020 NTS "Person" file. The file provided by Statistics Canada is "PERSON_NTS2020_PUMF.txt"; the zip bundle also includes the trips and visit files associated with those persons.

Because there is also the 2018 and 2019 data available, we want to be flexible in our code, so we can rerun it later with a minimum number of changes. Accordingly, we will assign the year of the data as an object.

```{r memisc_year}

nts_year <- "2020"

```

We can now use that in a variety of ways, as we define the locations of the various input files.


```{r memisc_inputs}

# define locations of input files

nts_year_format <- glue::glue(nts_year, "-SPSS")

input_folder <- here::here("data", nts_year_format)
input_folder

layout_folder <- here::here("data", nts_year_format, "Layout_cards")
layout_folder

columns_file_1 <- glue::glue("Person_NTS", nts_year, "_Pumf_i.sps")
columns_file <- glue::glue(layout_folder, columns_file_1, .sep = "/")
columns_file

variable_labels_1 <- glue::glue("Person_NTS", nts_year, "_Pumf_vare.sps")
variable_labels <- glue::glue(layout_folder, variable_labels_1, .sep = "/")


variable_values_1 <- glue::glue("Person_NTS", nts_year, "_Pumf_vale.sps")
variable_values <- glue::glue(layout_folder, variable_values_1, .sep = "/")

missing_values_1 <- glue::glue("Person_NTS", nts_year, "_Pumf_miss.sps")
missing_values <- glue::glue(layout_folder, missing_values_1, .sep = "/")

data_file_1 <- glue::glue("PERSON_NTS", nts_year, "_PUMF.txt")
data_file <- glue::glue(input_folder, "/Data_Données/", data_file_1)

```


The next stage is to create a definition of the dataset using the `memisc::spss.fixed.file()` import procedure.

```{r memisc_import}

nts_person_2020 <- spss.fixed.file(
  data_file,
  columns_file,
  varlab.file = variable_labels,
  codes.file = variable_values,
  missval.file = missing_values,
  count.cases = TRUE,
  to.lower = TRUE
)

# convert the resulting object into a "data.set" format 
nts_person_2020_ds <- as.data.set(nts_person_2020)

```


Do we need this?

```{r eval=FALSE}

outlist <- c("nts_person_2020_ds")

#save(list=outlist,file="sfs2016_efam_save.Rsave")
save(list=outlist, file = here::here("data_output", "nts_person_2020_ds.RSave"))

```



Convert to tibble. This tibble has all of the labels assigned, accessible via the functions in the {labelled} package.


```{r convert_to_haven_tibble}

nts_person_2020_hav <- as_haven(nts_person_2020_ds)
nts_person_2020_hav

```


In our final step, we will save the dataframe as an SPSS, Stata, and RDS files for future use.

One important note for Stata users is that there is a "version" argument, which allows us to create a file that can be read by older versions of Stata (the default is Stata 15).


```{r export}
# export haven format table as SPSS .dta file
haven::write_sav(nts_person_2020_hav,
                 here::here("data_output", "nts_person_2020.sav"))

# export haven format table as Stata .dta file
haven::write_dta(nts_person_2020_hav,
                 here::here("data_output", "nts_person_2020.13.dta"),
                 version = 13)


# export RDS 
readr::write_rds(nts_person_2020_hav,
                 here::here("data_output", "nts_person_2020.rds"))

```





### Factors

Factors behave differently than labels: they don't preserve both the label and the value. Instead they display the value and preserve the sort order (that can be either automatically set, or defined in the code).

In the code below, we will set all of the variables in the `df_video` dataframe as factors. In the first code chunk there are no additional parameters.

```{r}

(df_video_factor <- as_factor(df_video))

```

In this second chunk, the `levels` parameter is set to `both`.

```{r 250-df_video}

(df_video_both <- as_factor(df_video, levels="both"))

```
