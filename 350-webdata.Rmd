# Data from web sources {#webdata}

In this chapter:

* Importing data from web repositories




There is a lot of valuable data out there on the internet, just waiting for curious data analysts to find nuggets of insight in it. There are a variety of ways to access that data; in some cases, you can download a CSV or Excel file and then read that into R.

But the brilliant people that make up the R community have made our life a whole lot easier by creating packages that allow us to write R scripts that link directly to data we want. This is particularly valuable if you are accessing a data set that gets updated regularly (say, a weekly financial report or the results of a monthly survey).

The foundation of this connection to data sources on the internet are APIs (for Application Programming Interface). APIs allow two pieces of software to communicate. In the context of data access, a site will be set up with an API that defines how data can be accessed, and how it will be provided.


There are two sorts of R packages that utilize APIs. The first are those that are dedicated to a particular source of data, such as a statistics agency. In addition to getting the data, these packages often have additional functions which do a lot of the initial manipulation of the data for us, getting it into a format that is useful for R.  The second are beyond the scope of this book, and are those that allow us to connect to the raw data source. Often with these sources, we will need to do some wrangling of the data before we can use it.


## R packages for direct connection

In this section, we will explore examples that allows access to the data repositories hosted by the UK Office of National Statistics and Statistics Canada. There are many other tools available; some are listed at the end of this chapter.




### Office of National Statistics (UK)

Our first example will be {onsr}, which downloads data directly from the UK's Office of National Statistics [@R-osnr].

```{r api_onsr, eval=FALSE}
library(onsr)
```

For this, we would like to obtain time series data of retail sales. 

The first thing we might want to do is explore what's available in our area of interest. The `ons_datasets()` function gives a full list of the data that is currently available.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasets <- ons_datasets()

datasets |> 
  select(id, description) |> 
  filter(str_detect(id, "retail"))

```

From this, will select "Retail sales data for Great Britain in value and volume terms, seasonally and non-seasonally adjusted", which has the `id` value of "retail-sales-index".


The function `ons_ids()` provides a list of the `id` column that is obtained from the `ons_datasets` function.

Another option is the `ons_browse_qmi()` function, which opens the relevant ONS page in your web browser software.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ons_browse_qmi(id = "retail-sales-index")
```

Finally, we will use the relevant `id` value in an `ons_get()` function to retrieve the data. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df_retail_sales <- ons_get(id = "retail-sales-index")
```

There are 42,400 rows in this data (as of 2023-06-14), with multiple variables for each month. Your analysis will require further filtering and selecting, but with the {onsr} package providing the access to the data, you are well on your way.

### Statistics Canada

Statistics Canada, a department of the Government of Canada, provides a socioeconomic time series database known as "CANSIM". The data posted to the database is most of the aggregate data collected by Statistics Canada on a regular basis, such as the Labour Force Survey (from which we get updates on the unemployment rate), the Consumer Price Index Survey (about inflation), and health-related information from pregnancy and births to life expectancy and deaths.

The package {cansim} [@R-cansim] uses the API that Statistics Canada has created in order to facilitate direct download of hundreds of data tables, and thousands of individual time series. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(cansim)     # access Statistics Canada's CANSIM data repository
```


One of the many tables related to international travel that is published in CANSIM is "Table: 24-10-0050-01 Non-resident visitors entering Canada, by country of residence". ^[The webpage for the table, showing the most recently available data, is here: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2410005001]



Here's a screenshot of the table, showing the number of people arriving by their continent of residence. 

![table](img\cansim_25-10-0050-01_2020-09-10_2023-09-30.PNG)


This table might be useful if you were developing a marketing campaign and you wanted to understand where tourists are coming fromâ€”the biggest markets and the fastest growing. But as shown, it is at too high a level; this is Canada by continent. For our purposes, we need to see specific country, those entering Canada via British Columbia, and a longer time series. 

We could use the filters and fiddle around making sure we got the right selections and then download the data, but if we have to do that next month it is going to be inefficient. We could also first click on the "download options" button and select "download entire table..." but again, this is not the most efficient way to do this, since there are a few manual steps we have to take and then open the file into R and filter to select the series we want. 

This is where the {cansim} package comes it. 

Step 1: download the data.

* the `get_cansim()` function takes the table number as the parameter, and connects to CANSIM and downloads the data into an R dataframe.

```{r get_cansim_2410005001, eval=FALSE}

travellers <- get_cansim("24-10-0050-01")

```

We will come back to filtering and variable selection along with working with date fields later, but here's the code in R using the functions of the {dplyr} package to filter for the British Columbia cases during the month of June 2019:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

travellers_bc <-
travellers |> 
  filter(GEO == "British Columbia",
         REF_DATE == "2019-06")

glimpse(travellers_bc, width = 65)

```

There are 287 rows, one for each of the categories in the `Country of residence` variable. It's important to note that these are not just countries, but the variable also includes subtotals. What if we just want a monthly report on a single continent? One option would be for us to filter the "COUNTRY" variable; here we filter for visitors from Europe.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
travellers_bc |> 
  filter(`Country of residence` == "Europe")
```


One of the features of CANSIM and other similar tables is that the individual series are given a single identifier. In the case of CANSIM, these are called the "vector numbers". Scroll to the right on this table, and you'll see a variable called `VECTOR`. The vector identifier (sometimes called "the vector number" even though it's a character string!) for European travellers entering Canada via British Columbia is v1277198032.

The {cansim} package also gives us a function to select a single vector number, so we can be more efficient still. We can speed up the download time _and_ skip the filtering steps to get to the one we want. (Note that this function requires us to enter a start date, and converts the reference date variable to the YYYY-MM-DD format.)

```{r get_cansim_vector, eval=FALSE}

get_cansim_vector("v1277198032", start_time = "2015-01-01")

```

This table has the shortcoming of not including the "GEO" or "Country of residence" variables, so we need to ensure that we have adequately documented what has been accessed.

The {cansim} package includes other very useful functions if you find yourself exploring Statistics Canada data sets. 

The function `get_cansim_table_overview()` provides an abstract about the data table.

```{r get_cansim_table_overview, eval=FALSE}

get_cansim_table_overview("24-10-0050-01")

```
